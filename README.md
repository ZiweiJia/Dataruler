A web page to give the recommendation of sport and entertainment events for users


The work I did:

⚫ Developed an interactive web page (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX) to find nearby events and provide personalized recommendation for users.
⚫ Built Java servlets with RESTful APIs to handle HTTP operation (requests and responses).
⚫ Collected event data (brand, name description, location, transportation info) from some ticket website (like
Ticketmaster) API with databases (MySQL, MongoDB).
⚫ Designed algorithms (e.g., User-based recommendation) to provide suitable event recommendation.
⚫ Deployed server to Amazon EC2 to handle 140~160 queries per second tested by Apache JMeter.
